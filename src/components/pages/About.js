            <p className="m-5">
                    I am 37 years old living in Portland, Oregon with my beautiful wife Jessica. I have been lucky enough to live a life that is full of many wonderful experiences most could not dream of. I started off my professional careers as a regional Field Sales Manager for SmartPay leasing in San Francisco, CA. Whorking for a start-up comapany like SmartPay gave me the opportunity to work with a lot of great developers for the first time in my life. It was while working here that I found my true calling as a full-stack web developer. With bills never stopping I had to figure out a way to to make my dream come true. It was during this time I decided to leave the start-up I had worked for for 5 years in order to earn money required so I could attend school for a certificate in web developement.

                    For five years I ran and operated my own trucking company specializing in fire cleanup work after the Camp Fire wrecked havac on Paradise, California. While most people would see this as a strange turn of events, I took it as a step towards my ultimate goal of being a full-stack web developer. In December of 2022 I officially completed the University of Oregon Full-Stack Web Developer program. Now I am continuing my education while searching for someone to take a shot on me.

                    I have been through a wide range of challanges in my life that have made me the person I am today. I have worked with all types of people from truckers to developers and sales teams. This gives me the ability to work with anyone on any project. If I have learned anything in life is that you can never stop learning. This is why I am still continuing my learning journey.
